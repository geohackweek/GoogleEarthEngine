# Contributing

[Geohackweek][ghw-site] is an open source project, and we welcome
contributions of all kinds: new lessons, fixes to existing material, bug
reports, and reviews of proposed changes are all welcome.

## Contributor Agreement

By contributing, you agree that we may redistribute your work under [our license](LICENSE.md). In exchange, we will address your issues and/or assess your change proposal as promptly as we can, and help you become a member of our
community. Everyone involved in [Geohackweek][ghw-site] agrees to abide by our
[code of conduct](CONDUCT.md).

## How to Contribute

The easiest way to get started is to file an issue to tell us about a spelling
mistake, some awkward wording, or a factual error. This is a good way to
introduce yourself and to meet some of our community members.

1.  If you do not have a [GitHub][github] account, you can [send us comments by email][contact].
    However, we will be able to respond more quickly if you use one of the other
    methods described below.

2.  If you have a [GitHub][github] account,
    or are willing to [create one][github-join],
    but do not know how to use Git,
    you can report problems or suggest improvements by [creating an issue][issues].
    This allows us to assign the item to someone
    and to respond to it in a threaded discussion.

3.  If you are comfortable with Git,
    and would like to add or change material,
    you can submit a pull request (PR).
    Instructions for doing this are [included below](#using-github).

## Using GitHub

If you choose to contribute via GitHub,
you may want to look at
[How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub][how-contribute].
In brief:

1.  The published copy of the lesson is in the `gh-pages` branch of the
    repository (so that GitHub will regenerate it automatically). Please create
    all branches from that, and merge the master repository's `gh-pages` branch
    into your `gh-pages` branch before starting work. Please do *not* work
    directly in your `gh-pages` branch, since that will make it difficult for
    you to work on other contributions.

2.  We use [GitHub flow][github-flow] to manage changes:
    1.  Create a new branch in your desktop copy of this repository for each significant change.
    2.  Commit the change in that branch.
    3.  Push that branch to your fork of this repository on GitHub.
    4.  Submit a pull request from that branch to the master repository.
    5.  If you receive feedback, make changes on your desktop and push to your
        branch on GitHub: the pull request will update automatically.
